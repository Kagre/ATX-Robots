# ATX-Robots
A codebot battle royal game loosely based on the x86 assembly programming language

## Special Note

 Like those who've come before me the idea of this game is not mine, I have only 
added my bits to it in an effort to pass the torch on to the next generation.
The creator of the original AT-Robots is Ed T. Toton III & NecroBones Enterprises.
The original program is AT2, available at www.necrobones.com/atrobots
This version,ATX, builds on some of the fundamental concepts of both ATR2 and ATR3 
by Richard Bartelt; however it is the intent of this edition to be a fully
rewritten web-suite... Yet it would not do justice to the OP to go without saying:

*This product includes software developed by Ed T. Toton III & NecroBones Enterprises.*

## Introduction
 Here in lies a game where the players are programmers whose coded creations are
placed into a winner take all last bot standig battle royal combat arena.

 This is by no means a new game concept and while the name for this game is
realated to the ATX PC formfactor, it is also a callback to the lineage of
videogames that have lead up to this point: 
* AT-Robots 3 (c) 2002 Richard Bartelt
* AT-Robots 2 (c) 1997 Ed T. Toton III
* AT-Robots (c) 1992 Ed T. Toton III
* T-Robots (c) 1991 Ed T. Toton III
* P-Robots (c) 1988 David Malmberg
* C-Robots (c) 1985 Tom Poindexter

## Under-Construction
The game is still in the concept/design phase, I will try and get more rolled out
soon however the general outline is as follows
* ToDo
  * Write game manual
  * everything else
* Outline
  * Game Arena
    * HTML5/JavaScript/WebGL
    * game itself should be able to run from client side copy in local folder
    * also needs to run server serverside(node?) for official tournaments
 * Player website
   * Basic website to login and share bots and signup for tournaments
     * HTML with SQL
     * CodeMirror
   * Game Concepts
     * Hardware and Assembly Code
     * mabye in v2 add more than just x86
